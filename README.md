## AWS Elastic Load Balancer
AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) is a managed load balancing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of applications or services running in Amazon's cloud infrastructure.

ELB automatically scales and manages the availability of the application or service by distributing incoming traffic to healthy instances and monitoring the health of each instance. It can also automatically route traffic to different availability zones (AZs) to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

There are three types of ELBs: 

1. Application Load Balancer (ALB)
2. Network Load Balancer (NLB)
3. Classic Load Balancer (CLB). 

ALB is best suited for HTTP/HTTPS traffic, NLB is designed for TCP/UDP traffic, and CLB is the original load balancer that is now being phased out in favor of ALB and NLB.

In summary, AWS Elastic Load Balancer is a scalable and highly available load balancing service that helps ensure the availability and performance of applications or services running in AWS.
